    @api.model
    def compute_rate(self, foreign_currency_id, rate_date):
        """
        Compute the rate and inverse rate for the given currency and date.

        If the foreign currency is USD then the rate will be the inverse company rate and the
        inverse rate will be the company rate, Else both rates will be the company rate.

        This is done because the foreign rate will be the rate that is gonna be shown to the user
        and the inverse rate will be the rate that will be used as factor to multiply for the
        computation of the foreign amounts.

        The logic is that if the foreign currency is VEF then we will be always multiplying by the
        value the user uses and see as the rate, but if the foreign currency is USD then we will be
        always multiplying by the inverse rate because the user will see the rate as the inverse
        rate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        foreign_currency_id : int
            The id of the foreign currency.
        rate_date : date
            The date of the rate that is gonna be searched for the given currency
            (foreign_currency_id).

        If no rate is found at or before rate_date (e.g. rate_date is older than any
        recorded rate for this currency/company), falls back to the oldest rate on
        record instead of returning nothing - callers default a missing rate to 0
        (see l10n_ve_sale's `_compute_rate`), and a stale-but-real historical rate is
        always a better result than silently zeroing out the order's foreign amounts.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary with the rate and inverse rate for the given currency and date.
